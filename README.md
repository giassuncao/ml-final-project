# Machine Learning Final Project
Giovanna Assunção Pereira Soares

A repository to make available my presentation and codes of my final project for the Machine Learning course by professor [Ivanovitch Medeiros](https://github.com/ivanovitchm). The project is about **Transfer Learning** with the goal to evaluate the performance of a pre-trained model using transfer learning techniques. It was chosen the pre-trained model [(MobileNetV2)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381v4) and applied feature extraction and fine-tuning techniques. The slideshow presentation is available [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGdf2BT9_4/Jq3bZAUgoremX9CRIdvcRQ/edit?utm_content=DAGdf2BT9_4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton). The [code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hi1-fIKWOMgyYQW416aCuBpNT-JGggQ6#scrollTo=_dwW6hZC4g25) was developed in Google's Colab Platform using Python coding and the [Brain Tumor MRI Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arifmia/brain-tumor-mri-image-dataset-updated/data).

Here's the video explanation (in Portuguese):
